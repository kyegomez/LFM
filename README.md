This is an attempt to make an open source implementation of LFMs, this is obviously not the official repository because it's closed source. I link papers below which I am using as a referrence.

## Installation
```bash
$ pip3 install -U lfm-torch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from lfm_torch.model import LFModel
from loguru import logger

# Instantiate and test the model
if __name__ == "__main__":
    batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim = 32, 128, 512
    token_dim, channel_dim, expert_dim, adapt_dim, num_experts = (
        embedding_dim,
        embedding_dim,
        embedding_dim,
        128,
        4,
    )
    model = LFModel(
        token_dim, channel_dim, expert_dim, adapt_dim, num_experts
    )

    input_tensor = torch.randn(
        batch_size, seq_length, embedding_dim
    )  # 3D text tensor
    output = model(input_tensor)
    logger.info("Model forward pass complete.")
```


## Liquid Transformer 
A novel neural architecture combining Liquid Neural Networks, Transformer attention mechanisms, and Mixture of Experts (MoE) for enhanced adaptive processing and dynamic state updates. Very experimental and early! We're working on a training script [here](./liquid_transformer_train.py). It still needs an actual tokenizer like llama's tokenizer but it's getting there. If you can help with this then let me know.

```python
import torch
from loguru import logger

from lfm_torch.liquid_t_moe import LiquidTransformer

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    seq_len, batch_size, embed_size = 10, 2, 64
    num_heads, num_experts, expert_size, num_layers = 8, 4, 64, 6

    # Create the model
    model = LiquidTransformer(embed_size, num_heads, num_experts, expert_size, num_layers)

    # Example input tensor
    x = torch.randn(seq_len, batch_size, embed_size)

    # Forward pass
    output = model(x)
    logger.info(f"Model output shape: {output.shape}")
```
